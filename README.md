# symbench studio

Initial setup of symbench studio for interactive exploration of relevant optimization problems

# Usage

1. `cd symbench-studio && ./setup.sh`
2. `streamlit run app.py`

# TODO 
- [ ] Constraint_prog solver connection to frontend
- [ ] Select by specific problem (e.g. circle packing) instead of optimization problem type
- [ ] show visualization after solve or view Pareto fronts of previous solves
- [ ] comparison of solve speeds
- [ ] Add sidebar Nav for selecting and solving problems vs viewing results from previous solutions
