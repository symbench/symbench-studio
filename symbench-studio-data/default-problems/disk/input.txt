## A constraint-satisfaction problem to solve x*x + y*y <= 1 such that:
## - x in [-2,2]
## - y in [-2,2]
## and the goal is to:
## - maximize 2 * sqrt(x*x + y*y)
variable x -2 2.5
variable y -2 2.5
constraint c1 leq(sqrt(x*x+y*y),1)
constraint c2 geq(x,0.5)
projection d 2*sqrt(x*x+y*y)
projection x1 x
projection y1 y
maximize d
minimize x1
minimize y1
